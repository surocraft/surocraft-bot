This version of [minecraft-bot project](https://github.com/PetyXbron/minecraft-bot), called [surocraft-bot](https://github.com/surocraft/surocraft-bot) is modified as the original project offers. Modified config, added new commands, edited README.md file, modified Discord.js events and index.js file to personally improve the interaction with the SuroCraft. Also installed new dependencies to support custom features.
